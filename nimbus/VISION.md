# Vision - The Open Source Analytics Revolution

## Our Mission

**Make enterprise-grade event analytics accessible to everyone, without the $2,000/month price tag.**

Segment and Mixpanel are powerful but expensive. Most companies don't need all their features, but they pay premium prices for basic event tracking. We're changing that.

## The Problem We're Solving

### 1. **Cost Barrier**
- Segment charges $500-$10,000+/month based on event volume
- Mixpanel charges $25+/user/month for basic features
- Small startups and scale-ups can't afford these prices
- Large companies waste millions on features they don't use

### 2. **Data Ownership**
- Your data lives on their servers
- No direct database access
- Limited export options
- Vendor lock-in makes switching painful

### 3. **Compliance Challenges**
- Healthcare, finance, government can't send data externally
- GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements
- Need self-hosted solutions

### 4. **Limited Customization**
- Can't modify their code
- Stuck with their integrations
- Can't add custom features
- "Contact sales" for everything

## Our Solution

### **Nimbus = Segment's capabilities + Open Source freedom**

We're building a complete replacement that:
- ✅ Costs 90% less (only infrastructure, no software fees)
- ✅ Runs in your infrastructure (complete data ownership)
- ✅ Fully customizable (open source, fork and modify)
- ✅ Modern tech stack (async Python, latest best practices)
- ✅ No vendor lock-in (own your analytics forever)
